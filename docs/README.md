# Welcome!

Welcome to the [HiberniaDiscord](https://hiberniadiscord.paradaux.io) Documentation! 

These docs are centred around HiberniaDiscord v**4.0.0** if you are not using this version, please update! You can download HiberniaDiscord [here](/#/downloads)!

This website is a list of various curated resources which will help you get setup and make the most of your HiberniaDiscord Installation.

Installation Instructions are broken down by platform, which includes setting up a basic server/proxy for that platform, and assumes no prior knowledge. HiberniaDiscord is configured using a format known as HOCON which you can read more about [here](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md). HOCON is designed with human configuration in mind and is much more powerful for developers than YAML which has been the de facto standard for years.

If you have any questions you can join the Paradaux Development Centre on discord by using the invite link [here](https://paradaux.io/discord), there we can provide you with more personal support, but we would much prefer if you could make use of these resources before reaching out there. 

## Installation Instructions

| Bukkit-based Server Software (Spigot, Paper, Tuinity, Purpur, Airplane etc) Instructions |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bungeecord Proxy Installation (BungeeCord, RedisBungee, Waterfall etc) Instructions** |
| **Velocity Proxy Installation Instructions**                 |

| **Fabric**: Coming Soon!                                     |

**N.B**: These installation instructions are work in progress, as HiberniaDiscord **v4.0.0** has yet to be released to the public. 

## Configuration Instructions

Configuration values and available events may vary between implementations, due to limitations of the platform. I will make a feature chart available for each version when the feature set for 4.0.0 is finalised.
